In server operations and application deployment, process management is a crucial topic. How do you ensure applications run continuously? How do you automatically restart programs after crashes? How do you manage multiple processes? Supervisor is a tool designed to solve these problems. This article will comprehensively introduce Supervisor's usage, from basics to advanced topics, helping you master this powerful process management tool.

## What is Supervisor?

Supervisor is a process management tool written in Python that can convert a regular command-line process into a background daemon and monitor its running state, automatically restarting it when it exits. It provides rich configuration options and convenient management interfaces, making it one of the preferred tools for service process management on Linux/Unix systems.

### Key Features of Supervisor:

- Process start, stop, and restart
- Automatic process restart after crashes
- Process group management
- Log management
- Web management interface
- Permission management
- Event notifications

## Installing Supervisor

Installing Supervisor is straightforward and can be done through package managers or pip.

### Using Package Managers

On Ubuntu/Debian systems:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install supervisor
```

On CentOS/RHEL systems:
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install supervisor
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install supervisor
```

After installation, Supervisor creates these important files and directories:

- `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf`: Main configuration file
- `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`: Program configuration directory
- `/var/log/supervisor/`: Log file directory

## Basic Supervisor Configuration

### Main Configuration File

Supervisor's main configuration file is typically located at `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf` and contains global settings. Here's a basic configuration example:

```ini
[unix_http_server]
file=/var/run/supervisor.sock
chmod=0700

[supervisord]
logfile=/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
pidfile=/var/run/supervisord.pid
childlogdir=/var/log/supervisor

[rpcinterface:supervisor]
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface

[supervisorctl]
serverurl=unix:///var/run/supervisor.sock

[include]
files = /etc/supervisor/conf.d/*.conf
```

### Program Configuration File

For each program you want to manage, create a configuration file in the `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/` directory. For example, create a file named `myapp.conf`:

```ini
[program:myapp]
command=/usr/bin/python /path/to/your/app.py
directory=/path/to/your/app
user=www-data
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/myapp.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/myapp.out.log
environment=PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
```

## Common Supervisor Commands

### Basic supervisorctl Operations

```bash
# Start supervisord
sudo supervisord

# View all program statuses
sudo supervisorctl status

# Start specific program
sudo supervisorctl start myapp

# Stop specific program
sudo supervisorctl stop myapp

# Restart specific program
sudo supervisorctl restart myapp

# Reload configuration files
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update

# Enter interactive command line
sudo supervisorctl
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Process Group Management

You can organize multiple related programs into a group:

```ini
[group:mygroup]
programs=prog1,prog2,prog3

[program:prog1]
command=/path/to/prog1
...

[program:prog2]
command=/path/to/prog2
...

[program:prog3]
command=/path/to/prog3
...
```

### Environment Variable Configuration

```ini
[program:myapp]
command=/path/to/app
environment=
    PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
    NODE_ENV="production",
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"
```

### Event Listeners

```ini
[eventlistener:memmon]
command=memmon -p program_name=1GB
events=TICK_60
```

## Log Management

Supervisor provides powerful log management capabilities:

```ini
[program:myapp]
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/myapp.out.log
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/myapp.err.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=50MB
stdout_logfile_backups=10
stdout_capture_maxbytes=1MB
stderr_capture_maxbytes=1MB
```

## Web Interface Configuration

You can enable Supervisor's web interface for visual management:

```ini
[inet_http_server]
port=*:9001
username=admin
password=123456
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set Appropriate Restart Policies**
```ini
[program:myapp]
startretries=3
startsecs=10
stopwaitsecs=10
```

2. **Control Start Order with Priorities**
```ini
[program:database]
priority=100

[program:webapp]
priority=200
```

3. **Set Resource Limits**
```ini
[program:myapp]
user=nobody
umask=022
```

## Common Troubleshooting

1. **Process Won't Start**
- Check command path correctness
- Verify user permissions
- Review error logs

2. **Auto-restart Not Working**
- Confirm `autorestart` configuration
- Check `exitcodes` settings

3. **Log File Permission Issues**
- Ensure log directory exists
- Check directory permissions

## Conclusion

Supervisor is a powerful and user-friendly process management tool that helps us:

- Convert regular processes into daemons
- Implement automatic process restarts
- Provide convenient process management interfaces
- Handle log recording
- Support process group management

Through proper configuration and use of Supervisor, we can greatly simplify server process management and improve system reliability and maintainability.
