## What is GitHub?

GitHub is the world's largest code hosting platform, serving not only as a version control system but also as an open-source community and collaborative development platform. Through GitHub, developers can:

- Store and manage code
- Track code changes
- Collaborate with teams
- Participate in open-source projects
- Manage project progress

## Core Features

### 1. Repository

Repositories are GitHub's basic units, used to store all project files and history:

- Create public or private repositories
- Support multiple programming languages
- Include README, license, and project documentation
- Provide detailed change history

### 2. Branch

Branches allow development without affecting the main code:

- main/master branch: stores stable version code
- feature branches: develop new features
- hotfix branches: fix urgent issues
- release branches: prepare for version releases

### 3. Pull Request

Pull Request (PR) is the core mechanism for collaborative development:

- Submit code change requests
- Conduct code reviews
- Discuss and improve code
- Merge into target branches

### 4. Issues

Issues are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bug reports:

- Describe problems or requirements
- Assign to team members
- Set labels and milestones
- Link related PRs

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Message Standards

```bash
# Good commit message examples
feat: add user login functionality
fix: resolve slow homepage loading
docs: update API documentation
style: optimize code formatting
```

### 2. Branch Management Strategy

- Use meaningful branch names
- Merge or delete outdated branches promptly
- Protect important branches (like main)
- Regularly sync remote code

### 3. Project Documentation Maintenance

- Write clear READMEs
- Update documentation regularly
- Add contribution guidelines
- Use Wiki for detailed documentation

## Common Features

### 1. GitHub Actions

Automated workflows:

- Automated build and testing
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Automated version releases
- Code quality checks

### 2. GitHub Pages

Host static websites:

- Project documentation
- Personal blogs
- Portfolio showcases
- Technical documentation

### 3. GitHub Packages

Package management service:

- Publish packages
- Version management
- Access control
- Actions integration

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Efficient Searching

```bash
# Search in specific repository
repo:username/repo keyword

# Search by language
language:javascript keyword

# Search by filename
filename:config.js
```

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts

- `t`: Quick file finder
- `w`: Switch branches
- `s`: Quick search
- `g p`: Jump to Pull Requests

### 3. Project Management

- Use Projects boards
- Set milestones
- Utilize label system
- Link Issues and PRs
