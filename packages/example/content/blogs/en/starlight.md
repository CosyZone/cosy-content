Starlight is a documentation theme tool in the Astro ecosystem, designed specifically for building modern, high-performance documentation websites. Built on Astro, it inherits its fast and flexible features while providing out-of-the-box documentation functionality. Here's an introduction to Starlight's core features:

## Starlight Features

2. **Theme Customization**: Offers configurable UI themes, supporting customization of colors, fonts, logos, and other brand elements without writing CSS.

3. **Multilingual Support**: Built-in internationalization (i18n) solution, supporting multilingual documentation sites with automatic language switching and routing.

4. **Smart Search**: Integrated full-text search functionality with keyboard shortcuts and highlighted search results.

5. **SEO Optimization**: Automatically generates proper meta tags, Open Graph data, and structured data to improve search engine visibility.

6. **Component Library**: Provides rich built-in components including tabs, code blocks, version notices, and more to accelerate documentation writing.

## How to Use Starlight

### Creating a New Project

Use the following command to create a Starlight-based documentation project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

### Project Structure

Typical Starlight project structure:

- `src/content/docs/`: Markdown/MDX documentation content
- `src/configs/`: Configuration files (theme, navigation bar, etc.)
- `public/`: Static assets
- `astro.config.mjs`: Astro configuration file

### Basic Configuration

Configure basic information in `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: 'My Documentation',
      social: {
        github: 'https://github.com/your-repo',
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Adding Documentation Content

Create `.md` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory:

````markdown
---
title: Quick Start
---

# Installation Guide

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
````

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

````

### Customizing Theme

Modify theme colors through configuration file:

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
starlight({
  // ...other configurations
  components: {
    theme: {
      colors: {
        primary: {
          hue: 200,
          saturation: 100,
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
````

## Best Practices

1. Enhance content with components:

   ````markdown
   ## Feature Demo

   <Tabs>
     <Tab label="React">
       ```jsx
       function Counter() { ... }
       ```
     </Tab>
     <Tab label="Vue">
       ```vue
       <script setup>
       const count = ref(0)
       </script>
       ```
     </Tab>
   </Tabs>
   ````

2. Utilize version control:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Changelog
   version:
     current: v2.0
   ---
   ```

## Deploying Documentation

Starlight supports all Astro-compatible deployment platforms. Recommended approach:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the generated `dist/` directory to your hosting service.

## Conclusion

Starlight provides a modern solution for creating and maintaining technical documentation. Combined with Astro's performance advantages and out-of-the-box documentation features, it's an ideal choice for building product documentation, API references, and technical guides. Through its rich configuration options and extensibility, you can easily create professional-grade documentation sites.
