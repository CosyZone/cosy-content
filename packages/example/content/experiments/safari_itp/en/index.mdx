# Safari ITP Impact Experiment

This experiment explores how Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) affects web applications and user privacy. We'll create a simple web application that demonstrates various tracking mechanisms and observe how ITP blocks or modifies them.

## What is ITP?

Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) is a privacy feature in Safari that helps prevent cross-site tracking. It works by:

1. Limiting third-party cookies
2. Partitioning first-party cookies
3. Blocking certain types of tracking scripts
4. Modifying how localStorage and sessionStorage work

## What We'll Test

In this experiment, we'll create a web application that demonstrates:

1. Third-party cookie behavior
2. First-party cookie partitioning
3. localStorage and sessionStorage restrictions
4. Cross-site request tracking
5. User fingerprinting attempts

## Getting Started

To run this experiment:

1. Open Safari and check your ITP settings:
   - Go to Safari > Settings > Privacy
   - Look for "Cross-site tracking" setting

2. Visit our test application:
   - [Test Application](/experiments/safari_itp/en/1)

3. Try different scenarios:
   - With ITP enabled
   - With ITP disabled
   - In different Safari versions

## Expected Results

We expect to observe:

- Third-party cookies being blocked or partitioned
- localStorage restrictions in cross-site contexts
- Modified behavior of tracking scripts
- Different results based on Safari version and ITP settings
