## XI. Glossary

Terms used in this privacy protection guide have the following definitions in general:

Personal Information: Personal information refers to various information recorded electronically or in other ways that can identify a natural person's identity alone or in combination with other information, including but not limited to a natural person's name, date of birth, ID number, personal biometric information, address, phone number, etc.

Personal Sensitive Information: Personal sensitive information refers to personal information that, if leaked, illegally provided, or misused, may endanger personal and property safety, or easily lead to personal reputation damage, physical and mental health harm, or discriminatory treatment. For example, personal sensitive information includes ID numbers, personal biometric information, bank account numbers, communication content, health and physiological information, etc.

Device: Device refers to equipment that can be used to access QuickEasy products and/or services, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, or smartphones.

Unique Device Identifier: A unique device identifier (Exclusive ID or UUID) refers to a string of characters embedded in the device by the device manufacturer that can uniquely identify the corresponding device (such as a phone's IMEI number). Unique device identifiers have multiple uses, including providing advertising when cookies cannot be used (such as in mobile applications).

IP Address: Each internet-connected device is assigned a number called an Internet Protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned based on geographic regions. IP addresses can usually be used to identify the location where a device connects to the internet.

SSL: SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a security protocol implemented on the transmission communication protocol (TCP/IP). SSL supports various types of networks while providing three basic security services, all achieved through the use of public key and symmetric key technology to achieve information confidentiality.

Information Collection Technology: The "automatic collection" mentioned in the QuickEasy Privacy Protection Guide includes the following methods: A. Cookie Cookie is a small text file that the website server places in the client (your computer, mobile phone, or other smart terminal) when you browse web pages. When you visit the corresponding website again, the website can recognize your browser through cookies. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to reject all cookies or display prompts when websites send cookies. However, without cookies, some website functions or services may not work properly. Please refer to the QuickEasy Cookie Guide for details. B. Web beacon Web beacon is an electronic image file or other technology embedded in websites or emails that can be used to count visitors, record whether and when you read emails or websites, or used to use certain cookies. C. Log files Log files store certain automatically collected data. Such data includes Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data, etc. D. ET Tag ET Tag is an HTTP protocol header transmitted between internet browsers and internet servers that can replace cookies to track individual users, allowing us to better understand and improve our services. E. JavaScript JavaScript is a programming language used to create more interactive and dynamic web pages. JavaScript can set cookies, read cookies, and delete cookies.

Affiliated Companies: Refers to any company or institution that currently or in the future controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with one party. "Control" means having the ability to directly or indirectly influence the management of the mentioned company, whether through ownership, voting shares, contract, or other legally recognized means.

Algorithm: The process or series of rules that computers follow when performing problem-solving calculations.

Application Data Cache: Application data cache refers to a data storage mechanism on devices. It has many benefits, such as allowing network applications to run without internet connection and improving related application performance by increasing content loading speed.

Browser Web Storage: The "browser web storage" mechanism allows websites to store data in the device's browser. When using this mechanism in "local storage" mode, data can be stored across sessions. This way, users can still access the corresponding data even after closing and reopening the browser. One of the technologies that helps implement web storage is HTML 5.

Account: As long as you register an account and provide us with some personal information (as explained in Section 3.1 of this guide), you can use our services. When you access QuickEasy, the system uses this account information to authenticate your identity to prevent unauthorized access to your account.

Non-Personal Identity Information: Information recorded related to users but cannot directly or indirectly identify your identity, including personal information provided through de-identification, anonymization, or pseudonymization.

De-identification: Refers to the process of technical processing of personal information so that personal information subjects cannot be identified without additional information.

Anonymization: Refers to the process of technical processing of personal information so that personal information subjects cannot be identified and the processed information cannot be restored.

Server Logs: Like most websites, our servers automatically record webpage requests you make when visiting the website. These "server logs" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, request date and time, and one or more cookies that can uniquely identify your browser.
